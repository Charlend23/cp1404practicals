# Practical 07
## By Charlend Shi
So, This is my reprository where i keep my Practical 7 file inside and about myself, i quite enjoy coding this past 6 months that i've been studying and i hope to learn more on the way so i can make use of this knowledge to help me find work outside.

Three Main Reason For Clean Code:
- Readability and Clarity for readers
- Each function should only do 1 task at a time
- So the work that we do will be Consistent
